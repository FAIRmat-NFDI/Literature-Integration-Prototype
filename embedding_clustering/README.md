## Overview
This project consists of two main parts:

1. **api_fetcher**: This component fetches data from the Nomad API and retrieves literature abstracts from the CrossRef library.
   

2. **Data Processing**: This component processes the fetched abstracts by embedding them and clustering them based on their subject matter


## Usage


To start fetching data from the APIs, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
After fetching the data, open the provided Jupyter Notebook in the **embedding_clustering** folder. Run the notebook to embed the abstracts and cluster them for further analysis.
